Assignment 3 consisted of 5 sections where 3 of which were code implemented and all provided in the files withinn the corresponding rep.

The first consisted of a queue that would run through taking the first element and push it to the back of the queue using the 
push, pop and front functions connected to the queue liibrary. 

The next is made up of a function that tests whether or not a string is a palindrome. Checking through and then again the second time and pushes the reults of it being a palindrome or not. 

The last code implementation is a map od data corresponding to certain states and the capitals related to each one of the states. 
After displaying the data in the map once the code changes the capital of a certain state then displays the data again. 
Once those sections are run the program then asks the user to input a state present in the map then output the capitol corresponding to the 
user input.
